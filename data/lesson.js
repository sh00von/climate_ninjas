Whether the massive ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland will melt gradually or abruptly once a tipping point is reached is still up for debate. A task committee headed by NOAA analyzes studies on sea level rise and projects future scenarios every four to five years. According to the 2022 assessment, sea levels might rise by at least 0.3 meters (1 foot) by 2100 under the lowest emissions pathway of 1.5°C, and by as much as 2 meters (6.6 feet) under the highest emissions scenario."

Reduced fire danger can be achieved through better forest management practices including thinning trees and removing dead wood. Wildfires can be put out before they spread by using fire patrols and satellite surveillance to spot them early. Fires can be contained with the use of advanced firefighting methods including backburning and helicopter water drops. In addition to community initiatives like evacuation planning and fire-resistant landscaping, legislation governing land use and open fires in high-risk regions is essential. Lowering greenhouse gas emissions as a means of combating climate change can also lessen the likelihood of major wildfires."
